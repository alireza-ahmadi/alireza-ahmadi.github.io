**death** has been my most recurring thought in the last few years.
**don't get me wrong**, i don't want to die; in fact, i wish to live for hundreds of years[^1] (_or forever_). so if it's
not suicidal thoughts, what's this notion that has been living rent-free in my head?

i've been thinking about **death** because, to me, it's **the most permanent** event that can
happen. i strongly (_or foolishly_) believe that **given time**, i can _proactively_ or _reactively_ shape the outcome of _most_[^2] events
to my liking; but death doesn't give you this privilege. this trait is what **makes death unique** and worth thinking about.

i use the word "unique" instead of "scary" or "bad", because i'm neither afraid of death nor consider it an [unfortunate
event](https://rintintin.colorado.edu/~vancecd/phil150/Nagel.pdf). it's just _an event_, albeit **the most absolute event**.
thinking about death helped me become more pragmatic, or i thought so.

i thought about death for years but it was more of an **abstract thought**, just a prominent part of my usual over-thinking.
it was more like _"how should i live my life before i die?"_ and less like _"what if i die just now?"_.
however, the situation [has changed](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-news-06-14-25)[^3] in the last 24 hours and suddenly,
my thoughts shifted more from the former to the latter.

and it's unbelievable how this subtle change of perspective led me to rethink my past thoughts.

i previously **expected** that an **increased chance of death** would make me more afraid of it; but it didn't. i rarely thought
about death in the past day or so. i had no stress yesterday, didn't feel the need to constantly check the news, felt upbeat enough to make
[hotdog for dinner](https://alireza.es/notes/favorite-hotdog), and slept well last night (_even though you could constantly hear the sound of explosions throughout the night_).

**what changed** though, **was the way that i weigh my actions**. the combination of _"death being the most permanent event"_ and _"there
is a higher than average chance that i die right now"_, makes you rethink your priorities.

i watched the famous [stay foolish, stay hungry speech](https://stevejobsarchive.com/exhibits/stay-hungry-stay-foolish)
more than a decade ago and while jobs' words were inspirational i didn't take grasp of it until **death turned** from a _distant
possibility_ to a _near one_.

assuming that _"i might not live to see tomorrow"_ **reshapes every single decision you make**. you start to question how
you're spending your time and why you're doing what you're doing. i can't believe the level of clarity that this simple
assumption brings.

you see, for the majority of my life, **i've always been hesitant to act**. i didn't take advantage of countless opportunities
because i couldn't take action; opportunities that could've revamped my life. thoughts like:

- what if i won't be capable?
- what if i fail?
- what if i make someone sad?
- i should wait for the right time

were always in the back of my mind. i spent more time "thinking about making the best move" than "making a move". but now when
i look back, death (_and the combination of its permanence and nearness_) shows me that i acted like a coward (_or perhaps been one_).

i don't know how the situation would unfold in the next few days or weeks, but i'm pretty sure that **hesitance to act is a
foolish behavior**. you might die now or in hundred years, it doesn't make a difference. however, **you'll always be dead inside
if you lack the courage to act**. even making a seemingly wrong move might lead to a better outcome than getting stuck in the same place.

[^1]: of course living that long isn't possible _now_, but who knows how technology will evolve in the future.
[^2]:
    _yes, yes,_ i definitly can't achieve the desired outcome in **all** cases but **even in scenarios where i failed, i had the
    choice** (_regardless i made the best choice or not_).

[^3]: i'm not sure this conflict would last long, but regardless it was a trigger for me.
