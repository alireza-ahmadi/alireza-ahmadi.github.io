hotdog is a simple food that can be made numerous ways. you have so many options when
it comes to toppings, sauces, bread, cooking methods, etc., but in the end, itâ€™s still a hotdog.

here is my favorite way of making a hotdog:

#### the bun

for the bun, i prefer the classic store-bought hotdog bun. **soft** and **slightly sweet**.
i don't like fancier buns because they sometimes over-power the hotdog.
but there is one thing that's necessary for me to enjoy a hotdog bun: **it must be steamed**.
steaming makes the bun softer and slightly chewy. if you haven't tried it, you should.

#### the hotdog

imho, the ideal hotdog has high ratio of beef, a good amount of seasonings (_not over-powering, a slight hint of smokeyness is always nice_),
and preferably a natural casing. [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn0bsLj9i3U) can give you some insight on how to choose a hotdog.

#### toppings and sauces

to me, toppings and sauces are not separate elements; it's their combination and balance that makes or breaks the experience.
my favorite combination is **minced onions**, **[minced pickles](https://pithandrind.com/diy-tarragon-vinegar-tarragon-infused-pickles/)** (_on the sour side_), a bit of pickle juice, a hint of sugar, freshly ground black pepper, mustard and mayo. mix all ingredients and put
it in the fridge for at least 1 hour.

#### cooking method

i've tried various methods and my favorite way to cook a hotdog is a combination of **boiling it for 2-3 minutes**, drying it with a paper towel,
and then, **grilling it until you see char marks on the outside**.

#### assembly

put the freshly grilled hotdog in your steamed bun and top with your toppings, enough to cover the hotdog from edge to edge but
not so much that it drips when you take a bite.
